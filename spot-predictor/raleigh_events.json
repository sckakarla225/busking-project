A beautiful young French woman, known only as 'O', is taken by her lover Ren to a splendid mansion near Paris. Here, she is initiated into an elite secret society, where she must learn to serve the sexual fantasies of Ren and his fellow members. But she must also explore the nature of her own darkest desires - and confront just how far she is willing to go for love.Below is a collection of notes about the book:-Story of O is a tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for sexual intercourse, offering herself to any male who belongs to the same secret society as her lover.-Through O's sexual exploits, the narrative explores themes related to gender norms and binaries, the role of clothing in identity, and humiliation as it relates to the social self.-In the early twenty-first century, many readers see The Story of O as a manifesto of a woman's right to erotic expression and self-determination, with O's sexual awakening, however tragic its outcome, seen as a kind of transcendence."

Some may refer to this as \u201cintrovert unite\u201d, and some may simply see it as an excuse to be in a different environment for reading. We love the cozy atmosphere and are excited to welcome you in to silently read, together in community. A non-alcoholic espresso martini in the lounge, reading whatever fits your fancy? No need to prepare questions, snacks, or tidy up the house? Casual chit-chat around books and love of reading? Yes, please.Joy, comfort, camaraderie, accessibility, books without homework, pretty NA drinks. That\u2019s the intention behind this series. Try it out.The bar opens at 11 on Saturday morning, hence the 11:15 \u201cstart\u201d time - providing you an opportunity to settle in while still getting a dedicated hour to reading. 45 minutes of unstructured interaction and discussion afterwards if you\u2019d like."
